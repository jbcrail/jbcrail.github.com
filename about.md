title: About

My name is Joseph Crail, and I've worked as a software engineer for over a decade. With a formal background in mathematics, most of my interest and writing will reflect this, but other topics may include:

* programming languages
* distributed systems
* data structures and algorithms
* data visualization
* service-oriented architecture

Even with an aptitude for technical topics, I've found many textbooks and papers difficult-to-read, so I strive to articulate these topics to a broad audience.

Have questions, suggestions, or job opportunities? Feel free to [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jbcrail).

Thanks for reading!
