Hi! I'm Joseph Crail. I'm a seasoned software engineer with a formal background in mathematics. Most of my interest and writing will reflect this, but other topics may include:

* programming languages
* distributed systems
* data structures and algorithms
* data visualization
* service-oriented architecture

Even with an aptitude for technical topics, I've found many textbooks and papers difficult-to-read, so I strive to articulate these topics to a broad audience.

Have questions, suggestions, or job opportunities? Feel free to contact me on any platform below.

Thanks for reading!
